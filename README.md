# prayerapp

A new Flutter project! 

Hey there! So the idea behind this app is to help Muslims keep not only theirselves but their friends accountable for praying 5 times a day. In order to do that, I wanted to make a group chat type service that allows you to anonymously nudge someone who hasn't marked that they've prayed before the time is up. 

I'm currently using Android Studio to work on the front-end design and I will use Firebase for the back-end stuf. I'm hoping to get this on both iOS and Android eventually, but iOS will come with time.


Stay tuned! I'm pretty excited about this project! :)
